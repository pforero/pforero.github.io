title: "About me"
---

I was born in Madrid, Spain but grew up in England. I studied Economics and Politics in the University of Exeter while I worked with interest in Finance over the summers. I then worked a year as an analyst for portfolio managers in a private bank in Spain.

I continued my studies in the Universidad de Navarra with a Master in Economics and Finance. There I discovered advanced economic models and statistical methods. This lead me to pursue a PhD in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence. There I studied from 2012 to 2017, focusing my research in International Trade and Macroeconomics, but did not end up defending my thesis. While researching I was highly interested in new computational methods that were only recently available with new technology.

In 2018 I moved back to Madrid to work at Allfunds. There I have worked in the Digital department and then the Innovation Lab, where I have had the opportunity to work in a wide range of technology focused projects. From using machine learning on customer behaviour, to software development and creating a new datalake in the firm. During these years I have been able to learn a wide range of new technologies and predictive methods.

I love that frontier between science and technology. My main interest lies in quantitative methods and modelling, specially under uncertainty. I believe that as technology keeps improving, what can be done can also be more ambitious. But it requires to a continuos learning process as the evolution is also continuos, and things become outdated faster than ever. I believe in technology as a tool. Technology is only worth as much as the purpose for which you use it.

These last years I have also grown a huge appreciation for the best industry practices in the technology industry, and how some of these can be extended into my work. I have seen how the most creative work comes from collaborating. And that the best work is not always the mos complex one, but the one that is easiest to communicate.

I hope to continue working in new challenging projects which force me to learn new things, in an environment that fosters innovation and with people form which I have as much to learn form them as I hope I can share with them what I know.
