title: "About me"
---

I was born in Madrid, Spain but grew up in England. I studied Economics and Politics at the University of Exeter while working in Finance over the summers. I then spent a year as an analyst for portfolio managers in a private bank in Spain.

I continued my studies at the Universidad de Navarra with a Master in Economics and Finance. There I discovered advanced economic models and statistical methods, which lead me to pursue a PhD in Economics at the European University Institute in Florence. There I studied from 2012 to 2017, focusing my research in International Trade and Macroeconomics, but did not end up defending my thesis. While researching, I was highly interested in new computational methods that were only recently available with the latest technology.

In 2018 I moved back to Madrid to work at Allfunds. There I have worked in the Digital department and then the Innovation Lab, where I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of technology-focused projects. From using machine learning on customer behaviour to software development and creating a new datalake in the firm. During these years, I have learned a wide range of new technologies and predictive methods.

I love that frontier between science and technology. My main interest lies in quantitative methods and modelling, especially under uncertainty. As technology keeps improving, what can we can do can also be more ambitious. But it requires a continuous learning process as the way technology evolves is also incessant. I believe in technology as a tool. Technology is only worth as much as the purpose for which you use it.

These last years I have also grown a vast appreciation for the best industry practices in the technology industry and how I can incorporate them into my daily work. I have seen how the most creative work comes from collaborating. The best approach is not always the most complex one, but that which is easiest to communicate.

I hope to continue working on new challenging projects that force me to learn new things. In an environment that fosters innovation and next to people with whom I can learn from them as much as I can share with them what I know.
